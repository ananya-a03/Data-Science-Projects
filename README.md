# ðŸ§  Data Science Projects Repository

Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository!  
This collection showcases various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, ensemble methods, and an introduction to time series analysis. Each project includes code, explanations, and relevant datasets (where applicable).

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Linear Regression**
A statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  
It assumes a linear relationship and is commonly used for predicting continuous outcomes.

**Key Features:**
- Simple & Multiple Linear Regression
- Model Evaluation Metrics (RÂ², MSE)
- Feature Selection

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Logistic Regression**
A classification algorithm used when the dependent variable is binary (0/1, True/False, etc).  
It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class using the logistic (sigmoid) function.

**Key Features:**
- Binary and Multiclass Classification
- Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, AUC
- Regularization Techniques (L1/L2)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Boosting Methods**
Ensemble techniques that build models sequentially, where each new model tries to correct the errors of the previous one.  
Boosting can significantly improve predictive accuracy.

**Included Algorithms:**
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Bagging Methods**
Another ensemble technique, but unlike boosting, bagging builds multiple independent models in parallel and combines their outputs.  
It reduces variance and helps avoid overfitting.

**Included Algorithms:**
- Random Forest
- Bagging Classifier

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Trial on Time Series**
A preliminary exploration of time series forecasting techniques used to analyze and predict future values based on previously observed data points.

**Key Features:**
- Time Series Decomposition
- Trend & Seasonality Analysis
- Basic Forecasting Models (still figuring out)

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Goals of This Repository
- To understand and implement foundational machine learning algorithms.
- To explore model evaluation techniques.
- To practice and improve end-to-end project structure and documentation.
